# IntroToIT
Labs from an introductory IT and web sciences class.

Taught by Professor Richard Plotka, Fall 2015.

This was my first class in web development, with a new subject (or two) presented every week.

Topics included HTML/CSS, javascript, jQuery, Internet protocols, web science, basic IT business principles,
server management, PHP, and RSS/ATOM.
